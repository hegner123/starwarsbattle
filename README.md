# Star Wars Battle
## A Javascript Game

Page [Github Page](https://hegner123.github.io/starwarsbattle/)

## Overview

This Javascript game allows one to fulfill their fantasy of pitting one of four Star Wars characters against the three other characters I have included.

Featuring Darth Varder, Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett, and Chewbaca.

## How to play

1. Starting from when you load the page, click on one of the four character icons to select your character. The number under each icon is that characters HP.

2. Once you have chosen your character you must select your opponent. Click on any of the remaining icons to select that characters as your opponent.

3. After both a User character (You) and a Computer character have been choosen the game will load the BATTLE ARENA! This is where you and your opponent will duke it out with each other until one of you is obliterated.

4. To attack your opponent you must click on the hard to see, easily missed, bright red button in the middle of the screen labled ATTACK.

5. After Launching your attack your opponent will automaticly launch their own counter attack. Continue to attack your opponent until they have been defeated, or you lose all of your hp.

6. If you successfully defeat your opponent you will be brought back to the character selection screen, choose your next victim... I mean opponent and battle them.

7. Repeat this process until all the remaining characters have been defeated.

## Easter Eggs
The instructions on the left hand side of the character select screen, when clicked, will scroll like the classic star wars intro.
